## Challenges
### Pokemon Browser App
- URL https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/
- The above URL lists all the pokemon objects
- you will find a link within each pokemon object which gives you more information on that pokemon
1. make a fetch request to the pokemon link and display the names on your browser
2. make another fetch within the first fetch to the individual pokemon link and display the following information for each pokemon
    - height
    - abilities
    - moves
    - image
### Use Another API
 3. Here's a list of some other APIs: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
- Pick any one of these and make a similar browser app.
PS: It'll be easier to implement the app if the API does not require any authentication(e.g. Studio Ghibli API)
